Writing out raw sumstats

-- Performing initial checks on input data:  --

i Columns: CHR, POS, RSID, EffectAllele, OtherAllele, B, SE, EAF, INFO, P, CaseN, ControlN, and rowid

-- Examining data for missing values across all columns 
  * Using tidyr::drop_na()
v Found no rows with missing values

-- Looking for duplicate rows 
If possible, selects the row with smallest pvalue in each duplication unit
i Using CHR_POS_REF_ALT as id

-- Checking for insertions/deletions ('indels') using:  
  1. EffectAllele or OtherAllele, character length > 1: A vs AA
  2. EffectAllele or OtherAllele coded as 'D', 'I', or 'R'
v Detected 0 rows as indels

-- Updating RSIDs that have been merged using RsMergeArch 
v Updated RSID in 175 rows

-- Finished initial checks --

  * 175 rows with updated RSID:

-- Starting validation of CHR,POS, RSID, EffectAllele and OtherAllele --

-- Validating the RSID column: 
  * Checking that RSID follows rs format: [rR][sS][1-10]
  * If rows fail rs format, look for CHR:POS or CHR:POS:REF:ALT format
i Found 307 rows with invalid RSID format. 
v All rows pass CHR validation
v All rows pass POS validation

-- Validating EffectAllele and OtherAllele: 
  1. Will error if not type = character
  2. EffectAllele and OtherAllele converted to uppercase
  3. Check for EA/OA values that are not A,C,G or T
  4. Check for NA
v All rows pass EA/OA validation
i Running validation of CHR and POS for invalid_rsid rows
v All rows pass CHR validation
v All rows pass POS validation
