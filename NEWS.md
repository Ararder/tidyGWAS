# tidyGWAS 1.0.0
This version comes with major changes to tidyGWAS.

1. File-parsing is now done with data.table. No need to use the `delim` argument 
2. tidyGWAS now accepts four possible inputs to `tbl`
  a) local filepath, 
  b) in-memory data.frame
  c) a GWAS catalogs study id (will download and process)
  d) a URL to a downloadable file (will download and process)
3. Column name guessing is now done automatically, and in most cases you should
not need to provide the column_names argument
4. INDELS are now supported, but requires you to update the reference data, see 
the zenodo repository. Set indel_strategy ="qc" to apply the same QC strategy to indels
5. tidyGWAS can now estimate ancestry proportions of the cleaned summary statistics
by the function decribed in https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/13/3477/6590645




# tidyGWAS 0.9.9.2
Updates:
1. Added experimental support for automatic column name guessing
2. Added experimental support for downloading and cleaning files directly from
GWAS catalog, using only study_id


# tidyGWAS 0.9.9
Added reference allele frequencies to the dbSNP155 reference data from zenodo.
Added the options to impute allele frequenecy from this reference data.


# tidyGWAS 0.9.7
added functionality for QTL summary statistics by providing the option to not
remove duplicated variants.

in addition, added the option to provide a custom reference file for allele frequency,
that will impute the allele frequency from the reference file if allele frequency is missing.

Added the option to impute N using SE and allele frequency.


# tidyGWAS 0.9.6

Added values that tidyGWAS detects as correct columns:
24 -> "Y"
25 -> "XY"
26 -> "MT"


# tidyGWAS 0.9.0

Major revision from earlier versions. The reference data format has been updated:

1.  Compression switched from gzip to snappy (better speed, and less installation issues)
2.  GRCh37 and GRCh38 have been merged into a single file, requiring only one merge to get CHR, POS and RSID for both builds.

This has introduced breaking changes in 0.9 vs 0.8, and in speed up of \~100% ( 2.5 minutes instead of \~5minutes). The new reference data can be found at
